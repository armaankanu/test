Pagan Min

Son of a mid-level drug boss in the Golden Triangle, Pagan Min was born in Hong Kong. His father was a small fish in a big pond and even as a young man, Pagan was as ambitious as he was flamboyant. This peacocking is what drove a wedge between father and son. Pagan worked for his father but hated him. He was frustrated as a lieutenant and saw his father as a dinosaur. After his father’s unfortunate passing, Pagan inherited his small piece of the pie. He then left his old identity behind and adopted the moniker “Pagan”, naming himself after an old Burmese king who had murdered his family to take control. Pagan quickly started carving himself more of the pie he believed he deserved: he built considerable assets, a small private army and started pissing off his allies in the heroin trade. But he didn't fit in: he knew he couldn't kill them all… It was only a matter of time before the old guard decided to have him killed.

This is when his eyes fell on Kyrat, a small failed state with multiple warring factions in the wake of the collapse of its monarchy. He allied himself with the Royalists, propping up a distant heir to the throne. After a few bloody months, Pagan and the united Royalists took the palace by storm, but Pagan betrayed the Royalists by murdering the heir in the palace and seizing the throne for himself. He then started a purge of anyone who didn’t fall in line, executing his opposition. This betrayal formed the Golden Path, a small resistance movement dedicated to overthrowing Pagan.

Pagan’s newly branded Royal Army took over Kyrat, corrupting existing business and infrastructure to the heroin trade and Pagan’s personal wealth. The Golden Path resisted but only in small guerilla skirmishes, never making any real ground...



Ajay

Ajay Ghale was born in Kyrat to Ishwari and Mohan Ghale. His father would become the leader of a rebellion in a burgeoning civil war to overthrow Pagan Min. However, tragedy befell the Ghales and when Ajay was only three years old, his mother fled with him to America. They left behind Kyrat, the war and his father. Ajay grew up as an American and was told close to nothing about his family history.
While growing up in the United States, Ajay landed in plenty of trouble as a kid, putting his mother through hell. He eventually fell in with the wrong crowd and was caught up in an armed robbery gone bad that led to a store clerk getting shot to death. Ajay was not directly responsible for the shooting death of the store clerk, but he turned himself in and bartered a deal – in exchange for no prison time, he provided the name of the person who pulled the trigger.

As Ajay was turning his life around, he learned that his mother was dying of breast cancer. She never told him, and it had now metastasized into her liver, leaving him with a scant few days to say goodbye in the hospice. The last lucid conversation they had was about Kyrat. His mom described the beautiful place they left behind when he was a child and spoke of regrets for things left undone. A few weeks later during the reading of her will, Ajay was given her last wish, an amendment made a few days before she died: "Take my ashes to Kyrat, to Lakshmana". With a mix of guilt, apprehension, and a little excitement, Ajay has entered Kyrat by way of India to fulfill his mother’s final wish.

Amita

Amita never knew her parents. Instead, she was raised by her uncle and aunt, both of whom supported the Golden Path under the rule of its beloved leader, Mohan Ghale. However, Mohan was never beloved by Amita. Instead, she hates his legacy

She felt he was fighting to keep Kyrat stuck in its old ways and even if they were victorious, her country would still be oppressed by tradition.

Amita is part of the new generation of the Golden Path and along with Sabal she has been key in bringing the rebellion back to a force that can actually make a difference. What Amita lacked in age, she made up for in passion and smarts, and she is considered the first female to officially join the ranks of the Golden Path, taking up arms, training and fighting alongside the males, marking a shift in traditional roles.

She quickly realized that the Golden Path was failing because they were waging a war they couldn’t afford to perpetuate. Amita knows that the infrastructure of Kyrat is shot, and even with independence, they won’t have the means to rebuild without first establishing a firm financial foundation. To this end, she believes in using Kyrat’s thriving drug trade to fund the Golden Path. Amita has kept the rebellion low key, planning out their strategies for the long term and stockpiling their assets. However she needs to show strength alongside Sabal, who is gathering his own supporters.

Amita is now being forced into action if she hopes to liberate her country and protect her people. With tensions rising, she’s now head to head with Sabal over the installation of Bhadra as Tarun Matara. Amita sees the practice as superstitious, old, and ultimately sexist, objectifying young women and robbing them of autonomy, a good education, and social life. She believes that intellectual, social, and financial progress is the only way to ensure a stable future for Kyrat.

With Far Cry 4, you will find yourself in Kyrat, a breathtaking, perilous and wild region of the Himalayas struggling under the regime of a despotic self-appointed king, Pagan Min. With terrain spanning from lush forests to the snowcapped Himalayas, the entire world is alive…and deadly.
• From leopards, rhinos, black eagles, and vicious honey badgers, Kyrat is home to abundant wildlife. As you embark on your hunt for resources, know that something may be hunting you...
• Scout enemy territory from above in the all-new gyrocopter and then plummet back to earth in your wing suit. Climb aboard the back of a six-ton elephant and unleash its raw power on your enemies.
• Choose the right weapon for the job, no matter how insane or unpredictable that job might be. With a diverse arsenal, you’ll be prepared for anything.


CO-OP: bring a friend!

As not every journey should be taken alone, Far Cry 4 allows for a second player to drop in and drop out at any point, re-imagining the cooperative experience in the true spirit of Far Cry for the next generation. You’ll now be able to discover and explore the living open world of Kyrat together!



Himalayan missions

A trip to Kyrat wouldn’t be complete without a visit to the highest peaks of the Himalayas! Throughout the game, you will come across a series of missions located at the peaks of snowy mountains. The Himalayan missions will push you to extremes: encounter avalanches, ride snowmobiles and fight for each breath as you live the effects of high altitude! The wingsuit might be your only chance at survival…



Shangri-la

Kyrat is also a beautiful land deeply rooted in its rich mythology. Shangri-Là is a fabled place that is part of that folklore and has been sought after by mortals in the hopes of finding enlightenment. Presented as a parallel and esoteric universe, Shangri-Là is a place where you will transcend into the limitations of your own mind and go to a place where legends live. You’ll encounter a completely different set of mythical enemies with unexpected and surprising behaviors. You will have an ally, a noble white tiger, the protector of Shangri-Là. The tiger comes to your defense when provoked or can be sent to attack nearby enemies. The Shangri-Là bow, with the exclusive ability to momentary slow time, will also be available while players unlock skills within the main skill tree.



Multiplayer


Far Cry 4’s new “Battles of Kyrat” multiplayer mode shows Kyrat in a completely different way. Your battles will take the form of a re-telling of the struggle that took place in a long-past war between The Rakshasa, Pagan Min’s elite guard and the Golden Path rebellion. In this asymmetrical experience, the different modes are round-based, so you’ll play as both classes in each match, in three game modes:
• In Outpost, the Golden Path works to establish an outpost in the region while the The Rakshasa are looking to rid the land of all non-believers, and secure the outpost for Pagan Min.
• In Propaganda, the Golden Path has to bomb and destroy these three propaganda installations, putting a stop to the spread of Pagan Min’s corruption.
• In Demon Mask, the both sides have to capture the mythical Demon Mask by using a combination of stealth and outright assault to bring it back to their home base. Work together to prevent these sacred artifacts and their unique powers from falling into enemy hands.



Map Editor
